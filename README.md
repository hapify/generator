## Model usage within a template

We will describe the structure of the object that represent a model when writing a template.

Before reading this, you should have a look to the [key-concepts](https://www.hapify.io/documentation/key-concepts) section.

### Within the templates

The following objects will be available in a JavaScript template.

**Model object**

-   `id` (string): an unique id
-   `name` (string): name of the model, as the user entered it.
-   `names` (object): name variants computed from the `name` property.
    -   `raw` (string): as the user entered it. Example `Online item`.
    -   `kebab` (string): example `online-item`.
    -   `big` (string): example `ONLINE-ITEM`.
    -   `header` (string): example `Online-Item`.

### Model injection

The template's input can be defined as `one` or `all` models.
During the generation process, if defined as `one`, the template will be called for each model. Therefore it generates one output file for each model.
If defined as `all`, the template will be called once for all models. Then it will generate one output file.

#### Single model

If the template requires one models, therefore, an object `model` (alias `m`) will be available as a global variable in the template.
In a `hpf` template it will be available under `M`.

#### Multiple models

If the template requires all the models, therefore, an array `models` (alias `m`) will be available as a global variable in the template.
This array contains all the available models.
In a `hpf` template it will be available under `M`.
